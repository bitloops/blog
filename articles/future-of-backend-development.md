## The future of Backend Development is written with high-productivity, fourth generation programming language

Let’s be honest, it sucks to have to execute the same mundane tasks when developing the backend of an app, SaaS or website, right?
That’s why we need a high-productivity programming language that reduces the time spent on boiler-plate code, that allows developers to focus on the core aspects of the application, and is flexible enough to not limit creativity. No, we’re not talking about Low Code or 

No-code platforms, which have their space and need in the market, but we’re talking about a model-driven, service-oriented programming language that will tenfold developer productivity and significantly reduce technical debt as applications grow. 

## Technical debt is viewed as inevitable 

The vast majority of tech companies have significant product and technology issues due to technical debt, sometimes even leading to technical bankruptcy. The speed at which products need to adapt and new features introduced leads to poor software development practices, limited refactoring and out-dated documentation. As a consequence, tech companies become slower and slower at releasing new features or updating their systems because the application architecture and setup doesn’t allow for fast iterations. In fact, most of the time there are large chunks of code or microservices that nobody knows exactly how they work or what they’re dependent on.  

Unfortunately, many times this issue is ignored or simply accepted as inevitable, which is leading to a need for more and more software engineering resources, which are particularly precious today. Engineers are hogged up fixing old or broken code instead of thinking about innovation, which can be fatal in our largely competitive digital world.

Therefore, it is paramount that we offer developers a better solution - something that will allow developers to maintain their productivity levels even when products become large and complex. New developers should be onboarded in days, not months! This improved productivity will inevitably leave time and resources that can be concentrated into a new, innovative product, freeing developer teams from performing redundant tasks that don’t bring anything new to the market. In turn, there will be more game-changing ideas floating around and a much quicker path to new developments in technology.

## Low Code and No-Code are not the solution

Low Code and No-Code have basically the same applications but are geared towards different professionals. These platforms provide drag-and-drop tools and simple interfaces, using a visual approach to the development process, as opposed to a more “bottom-up” approach of writing code.

The interfaces in No-Code solutions allow for business professionals with little to no technical knowledge to build their own applications; the Low-Code platforms allow IT professionals to benefit from pre-defined platforms that are more efficient, productive and allow some configurations to build software. 

These tools are very attractive as they are simple, easy to use, automate repeated tasks and provide boundaries on which developers can operate, limiting what developers are able to do which does reduce technical debt. 

However, these platforms come with several disadvantages and experienced developers are well aware of the issues these platforms can generate in the future, namely:
* Creativity limitation: developers are unable to create every single feature they desire
* Technology lock-in: the application is built on a specific platform and cannot be executed on any other platform 
* Resource management: new software developers need to be trained to use these platforms 
* Cost: these platforms are generally very expensive to run and not suitable for enterprise solutions

## Bitloops - 4th generation programming language for professional

The team at Bitloops was increasingly frustrated with finding technical debt in every company they worked at, and the fact that software development was everything but solving core problems! 

In addition, with the rise of mobile and web development, the supply chain of software development is becoming increasingly more complex and tech departments face various challenges: limited resources, lack of competent workforce, budget constraints and disagreements with business departments. Moreover, as applications become more complex, backlogs only grow further, so it's imperative we find a solution that can significantly reduce technical debt and improve time and cost to market.

Therefore, we decided to build a 4th generation programming language that would allow developers to build faster, better software. This high-productivity programming language is easy to learn and get started with and focuses on domain-driven design and behaviour-driven development (DDD/BDD), which ensures the application is designed and built correctly for that domain. Developers are able to add different API controllers (REST, GraphQL, gRPC) with just a few lines of code, and are able to build modular monoliths or microservices architecture, even being able to switch between the two as needed. 

The Bitloops language significantly reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed and it ensures alignment between business and engineering with a natural ubiquitous language. The Bitloops language is open-source and free to use, and it transpiles the code into widely used programming languages for maximum compatibility with existing code. 


## Still not convinced?

The world desperately needs more engineering capability, and this cannot be solved with the upcoming engineering graduates - we need a transformative change in productivity, and this can only be achieved with appropriate tools. 

The amount of time, money and resources that can be saved with Bitloops Language will enable faster time to market, more features, more testing and greater wealth creation. Developers will be able to finally focus on problem-solving and brainstorming for innovative solutions, generating real and transformative value to projects.

Additionally, given Bitloops Language’s style, it will enable business users to be more present in the development process and better utilise their insights and domain expertise to further enhance product management, sales and consumer relations, leading to a much more robust and marketable product.

The future of Backend Development will be, without any doubts, written with a high-productivity programming language.
