Every UI starts as a design—but getting from that design to production-ready code is anything but simple. Behind every button, layout, and variant lies a maze of decisions: how to structure components, handle responsiveness, plug into design systems, and avoid the kind of tech debt that quietly spirals out of control.

On the surface, this process might look like something AI should’ve solved already. But the truth is: it's still really hard. Most current approaches—whether it's copy-pasting from AI assistants or using rigid export tools—fall short where it matters most: clean, scalable, team-friendly code that’s ready for production.

That’s why we’ve spent the last year building **Bitloops**—a specialised AI coding assistant that doesn’t just generate code, but understands design structure, adapts to developer standards, and writes code like a senior frontend engineer would.

And now, with our **€1 million pre-seed funding round**, led by **Eleven Ventures** with participation from **Corallia Ventures** and several incredible angel investors, we’re doubling down on building the platform frontend teams actually need.

&nbsp;

## Where We Started

When we (**Vasilis and Sergio**) started Bitloops, we were bootstrapping while consulting and prototyping AI-powered tools to accelerate software development. The promise of LLMs was clear—but we kept hearing the same story from developers: the generated code might run, but it didn’t hold up in real-world projects.

What was missing? **Craftsmanship.** Tools that truly understood how to create reusable, responsive components that plugged into design systems and real development environments—without creating tech debt.

That’s when we knew we were onto something. By combining advanced AI models with the right workflow automation, we could translate Figma designs into production-grade React components—just like a senior dev would: structured, extensible, and fully documented.

&nbsp;

## Why We Raised

Let’s be honest—most AI-generated frontend code isn’t usable in production.

It might look good in a prototype, but it breaks under pressure. It ignores design systems. It’s hard to maintain. And it adds more tech debt than it removes.

We started Bitloops because we were tired of seeing developers waste time cleaning up after tools that were supposed to make them faster.

We saw the potential in LLMs—but we knew that real teams need more than code snippets. They need **structure**, **reliability**, and **flexibility**. So we built an engine that goes from Figma to code the way a senior developer would: clean, reusable, and documented.

This round gives us the runway to build the next phase of Bitloops: an AI-powered frontend automation platform that **respects your standards**, **scales with your design system**, and **fits your team’s workflow**.

&nbsp;

## The Problem We’re Solving

Ask any frontend engineer about the most painful part of their job, and you’ll hear the same things: endless CSS fine-tuning, fiddly responsiveness bugs, and repetitive setup of components and design tokens.

Sure, you can grab some code from ChatGPT or another AI design-to-code tool—but it usually takes hours of cleanup, doesn't match your standards, and often leads to fragile codebases.

**Bitloops isn’t just a Figma-to-React generator.**  
It’s a platform that turns static designs into **production-grade frontend systems**—fully responsive, componentized, and ready to evolve with your product.

We’re building:

- 🧱 **Reusable React components** that adapt to props and variants  
- 📚 **Storybook documentation** generated out of the box  
- 🎨 **Custom design system mapping**, not just one-off styles  
- 📐 **Built-in tests** for responsiveness and layout accuracy  
- 🔁 **Iterative workflows**—change your design, re-generate your code, and keep going

We’re focused on solving **real-world problems**, not just demo scenarios.

&nbsp;

## Why Now?

Frontend developers are under more pressure than ever to ship faster—but they can’t sacrifice code quality or maintainability.

Most current tools make you choose between **moving fast** or **doing it right**. Bitloops is here so you don’t have to pick.

With this round, we’re going deeper:

- Supporting component variants and multi-viewport logic  
- Expanding CMS and IDE integrations  
- Fine-tuning our proprietary AI models for accuracy and structure  
- Growing our engineering team across **Athens** and **Nicosia**

&nbsp;

## Where We Are Now

In just over a year, we’ve gone from concept to momentum:

- Participated in **StartSmart**, **Egg by Eurobank**, and **ITU Seed**
- Converted **200+ real-world Figma designs** into clean code
- Launched our MVP in **closed alpha**, with a **waitlist of 800+ frontend engineers**
- Submitted our **first patent** to the USPTO
- Won the **Innovation Prize** at Istanbul’s **Big Bang Startup Competition**
- Built a team of **eight engineers, AI researchers, and product builders**
- And just closed our **€1M pre-seed round** to fuel the next phase of growth

It’s early—but the signs are clear. There’s massive demand for a tool that takes design-to-code seriously, and we’re building it alongside the developers who need it most.

&nbsp;

## What’s Ahead: Building the AI Coding Assistant Frontend Teams Deserve

This €1M pre-seed round gives us the momentum to go deeper—not just in features, but in foundational tech. Bitloops isn’t a generic AI wrapper. It’s a specialised coding assistant trained for the realities of frontend engineering.

### 🔧  Product Development

- Full support for design systems, prop-driven component variants, and responsive logic at scale  
- Smart integrations with CMSs, testing frameworks, and version control tools  
- More granular control over layout behavior and less post-generation refactoring  

### 🧠  AI and Architecture

- Fine-tuning our **Domain-Specific Language Models (DSLMs)**  
- Smarter **component reuse** and nested structure detection  
- Expanded **Storybook and documentation** scaffolding  

### 👥  Team Growth

- Bitloops is a focused crew of eight—engineers, AI researchers, and product builders—working hands-on with every line of code and every user feedback loop.
- We’re hiring across engineering, product, and design to accelerate roadmap delivery, support our growing alpha community, and lay the groundwork for a category-defining platform.
